# Syntax Analyzer

## Description

The Syntax Analyzer is a program that implements a syntax analyzer (SA) for a simple programming language. Its main function is to ensure that a user's source program is syntactically correct according to the language's grammar. The SA generates appropriate and helpful error messages when necessary. This program serves as part of a compiler for the specified language. 

## Key Features

- Syntax recognition: The program analyzes the syntax of source programs and determines whether they are valid according to the specified grammar.
- Error reporting: The program generates detailed error messages to indicate the location and nature of syntax errors in the source code.
- Recursive descent parsing: The program uses a recursive descent parser to perform syntax analysis based on the grammar rules.

## Installation

To use the Syntax Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `
```
git clone https://github.com/miklovis/SyntaxAnalyzer.git`
```
3. Navigate to the project directory: 
```
cd SyntaxAnalyzer
```

## Usage

1. Run `compile.bat` file.
2. Run `execute.bat` file.
3. The program will analyze files stored in the `Programs Folder`.
4. You can find the analyzed output line-by-line in `output.txt` and you can find the result file (error outputting) in `res.txt`.
